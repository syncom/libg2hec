THE G2HEC LIBRARY

The G2HEC (Genus 2 HyperElliptic Curve) library is a free portable C++ library
providing divisor group operations in the Jacobian of genus 2 (imaginary)
hyperelliptic curve.  Such curves can be used for discrete-logarithm-based
cryptosystems with advantages over elliptic curves (genus 1 curves).  Divisor
group operations are essential to using genus 2 curves for cryptography.

It is built on top of V. Shoup's NTL library, "a high performance, portable C++
library providing data structures and algorithms for arbitrary length integers;
for vectors, matrices, and polynomials over the integers and over finite
fields; and for arbitrary precision floating point arithmetic."  The NTL
library homepage: http://www.shoup.net/ntl/

It is recommended to build NTL using GMP (the GNU Multi-Precision package) for
best performance.  However, the G2HEC library can be built and used with and
without the existence of GMP.  The GMP library homepage:

This library does not assume users' familiarity with any non-trivial math 
background except basic concepts of finite fields and polynomials.  No prior
knowledge of genus 2 curve is needed to used the library.

The G2HEC library is released under the GNU General Public License.  See the
file COPYING for details.
